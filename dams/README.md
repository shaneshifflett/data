* High hazard classification - loss of one human life is likely if the dam fails, 
* Significant hazard classification - possible loss of human life and likely significant property or environmental destruction, 
* Equal or exceed 25 feet in height and exceed 15 acre-feet in storage, 
* Equal or exceed 50 acre-feet storage and exceed 6 feet in height.
